        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to <strong>Survey C|</strong> ("the App"). This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles personal information. Short version: the App does not collect personal data.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p><strong>We do not collect any personal data.</strong> The App is designed to operate without collecting, storing, or transmitting personal information, including but not limited to names, email addresses, phone numbers, device identifiers, or location data.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>The App may offer in‑app purchases through the platform's payment system (for example: App Store or Google Play). Purchases are processed by the platform provider and/or payment processor; the App itself does not handle or store your payment card details.</p>
        <p>If you make an in‑app purchase, the platform provider may share purchase receipts or transaction identifiers with the App only as required for license validation or entitlement checks. Any billing or payment information is handled by the platform and is subject to their privacy policies.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Third‑Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App does not integrate third‑party analytics, advertising, or data collection services. If you use platform-provided services (for example account features provided by the store), those services may have their own privacy policies. Please review the platform provider's privacy terms where applicable.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Data Storage & Security</h2>
        <p>Because the App does not collect or store personal data, there is no user data stored by the App. If you choose to export or back up content using device features (for example saving a file locally), those files are stored on your device or your chosen backup service and are outside the App's control.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>The App is not directed to children under the age of 13. Because the App does not collect any personal data, we do not knowingly collect information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information in a way that is stored outside the App, please contact us to request removal.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Effective date" above. Material changes will be posted inside the App or on the App listing page where applicable.</p>
      </section>
